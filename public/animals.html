              <p>We don’t know all the darkness of past cruelty that Sedona carries with her but we do know it is significant and was life altering and defining for her.</p>
              <p>3 years ago an angel stepped into her life forever changing her journey. That angel is Liz Radley. Sedona was going to be sold back to the horse trader who likely had a hand in the past cruel offenses. Thankfully, her angel intervened providing her with a fresh start.</p>
              <p>Sedona spent 3 years with a trusted, skilled and compassionate trainer to find out if she could get through her past trauma and be safely ridden. It was finally determined that the amount of stress and fear being ridden created for Sedona, and huge risk for the rider, was not what was in her best interest.</p>
              <p>Another angel became part of Sedona’s next chapter. That angel is Marlene Dodge. She is one of the most intuitive horse women at understanding the individual needs and true essence of a horse. She knew the very best thing for Sedona was to go to a trusted sanctuary where she could just be but never be ridden.</p>
              <blockquote>AGN is honored to be that sanctuary.</blockquote>
              <p>Sedona is an extremely intelligent and intuitive being. Special beyond what we can even imagine. We believe her healing journey will be a transformative one not only for her but those she heals in the process. She is powerful medicine and we believe has a huge purpose in this life that will eclipse the notion of her being ridden.</p>

              <p>We received an email from a Tempe police officer asking if we had room at our sanctuary for an officer who was going into early retirement due to his disabilities.</p>
              <p>A gentle giant, who prior to his work in law enforcement, endured an extensive degree of neglect and abuse. Abuse that ultimately led to his disability and inability to fulfill his duties as an officer.</p>
              <p>Officer Moose suffers from a neurological condition that affects his coordination. This likely happened due to …a neck or head injury.</p>
              <p>This kind soul who has been deemed disabled for duty has many other gifts. Like the kindness he gladly shares with anyone who has the time to reach out a hand to pet him. Or the special interest he takes in all that visit. But his most special gift we believe will be the comfort and peace he will bring to Spirit as her new companion; all 17 hands and 1,400lbs of him. After all, a heart as big as his could never fit in anything smaller.</p>

              <p>Once upon a time there was a quarter horse ranch where beautiful paint quarter horses were bred.</p>
              <p>When the father handed the reins over to the son the future of the herd and ranch changed forever.</p>
              <p>The son chose drugs and the horses paid, some with their lives. They were eventually seized and sent on to a feed lot to go up for auction and likely purchased by killer buyers.</p>
              <p>Instead the entire herd was purchased by an incredible equine rescue. Unfortunately it was learned later that a couple of the stallions were purchased by another rescue with the intent of euthanizing them because they were unbroken stallions.</p>
              <p>Thankfully, their whereabouts were discovered. One of the stallions wasn’t so lucky though. He was euthanized just one day prior.</p>
              <p>The rescuer drove 5 hours to pick this boy up who had already been gelded.</p>
              <p>He was the herd leader. Unbroken with the quiet strength of an old soul. He had no desire to be broken. She respected this and waited for a sanctuary that would honor his desire and protect his unbroken spirit.</p>
              <p>Eight months later AGN learned of him. After speaking to the rescue it was decided he would find forever sanctuary at AGN.</p>
              <p>They made the 10 hour trip to AZ with our newest resident and long-awaited companion for Sky who has been alone for 10 months now since the loss of Thunder.</p>
              <p>We are looking forward to our new boy’s journey to accepting kindness from humans. I believe this most unique and special horse is going to not only heal a lonely horse’s heart but he will heal broken humans as well.</p>
              <p>In light of the stormy weather the day he arrived and because of his unbroken spirit, we have named him Storm.</p>

              <p>Spirit was used for trail riding and then abandoned at a boarding facility when she was no longer useful. Spirit’s teeth were so bad she could barely eat, leaving her over 200lbs under weight. She also suffered from an untreated eye condition.</p>
              <p>Once Spirit arrived at our Sanctuary & Healing Center, she received immediate veterinary treatment for her teeth and eye. Due to the severity of her eye condition, Spirit will require ongoing care.</p>
              <p>Like all of our residents, Spirit is provided with high quality nutrition along with immediate and on-going medical and daily care. Spirit’s habitat is covered to protect her from the elements and cooled with a misting system.</p>
              <p>We do not confine our equine residents to their stalls. Each completely covered extra-large stall opens to a large turnout area so they have unlimited enrichment.</p>

              <p>This frail, loving gentle and grateful soul wants nothing more than to just belong and be loved. A soft spot to rest, a kind hand, comfort care and a full tummy is such a small thing to need.</p>

              <p>What we didn’t know until her visit to the vet was that Duchy has stage 4 Kidney Disease. Years of the cheapest and worse foods contributed to this non-curable disease.</p>
              <p>Her heart and her body are broken now. We are thankful we are able to provide her with the prescription diet and medication that she will now need for the rest of her life.

              <p>Once in the care of AGN, an orthopedic specialists performed a thorough assessment.

              <p>Once she picked him up it was evident Solo needed urgent care. Solo was taken to the vet were it was determined due to the number of fractures in his leg amputation was the best option.</p>
              <p>Now, at age 6 Solo found himself in need of not just a sanctuary, but a lifelong sanctuary. He needed a special place where people could bring their love and leave with a heart full of new love. A healing love exchange.</p>

All 31 were seized and transferred to Circle L Ranch in Prescott, AZ. Several were pregnant. Little Ivy was one of the newborn piglets. AGN was contacted asking if we would accept Ivy as resident at out Sanctuary….we did not hesitate. Providing Ivy a good home at AGN is what our mission is all about.</p>

              <p>Wyatt is a friendly boy who loves everyone. He is currently housed in a temporary habitat until he is seen by our ranch vet and gets a clean bill of health.

              <p>We have a new resident at the ranch, albeit not our usual type.</p>
              <p>Clover, a Patagonian Cavy, was used in a petting zoo. Once that became defunct she was banished to a solitary life in an enclosure.</p>
              <p>Thankfully, her plight, and that of the other petting zoo victims, was learned by Dannielle Marturana of The Home Stretch Rescue. She was able to get Clover and several others removed but placing Clover was proving to be more challenging.</p>
              <p>With the placement of Ringo we had room in a fully enclosed habitat. After extensive research on nutrition and habitat needs we agreed to provide Clover sanctuary at our ranch.</p>
              <p>Clover is a very gentle and loving soul. It’s heartbreaking this very social being has never known the company of her own kind. We will continue to evaluate her needs and research other sanctuaries or rescues that may have a Cavy. Ideally, she will either be placed with another Cavy or we will bring in a female Cavy companion for her.</p>
              <p>Clover would love some visitors to help ease her loneliness. Please contact us via email or pm if you would like to be a love donor for Clover.</p>

              <p>Curly (western Curly not the 3 stooges) was surrendered by people unable to provide even his basic needs. He lived on a diet of human food found in the neighbor’s trash. He had not received any vetting or proper nutrition while living in their back yard. The only water source was filthy. They had originally gotten the calf as a pet for the children but planned to eat him when he was fully grown. Thankfully they were finally willing to give him up.</p>
              <p>Once Curly arrived at our sanctuary & healing center he received much-needed veterinary care, proper nutrition, clean water and love. Curly will never be made to suffer again.</p>
              <p>Like all of our residents, Curly is provided with high quality nutrition along with immediate and on-going medical and daily care. Curly’s habitat is covered to protect him from the elements and cooled with a misting system.</p>
              <p>We do not confine our livestock residents to their stalls. Each completely covered extra-large stall opens to a large turnout area so they have unlimited enrichment.</p>
              <p>Curly is available to meet, hug, scratch and kiss (by appointment only).</p>
